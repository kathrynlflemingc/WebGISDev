### Week 8: 
##### Task: 
Services in ArcGIS Enterprise, Services and Portal Items readings
##### Date: 
March 8, 2021
##### Time: 
1:30-3:00
##### Total Time: 
1.5 hours
##### Outcomes: 
Learned about the relationships between web services on ArcGIS Server and the ArcGIS Portal. In summary: 
All data used in ArcGIS Enterprise is made available by web services that can be queried by client apps. Geospatial services can include maps, scenes, geoprocessing tools, geodatabases and imagery. Web services are published from ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap and run on server sites. This is made possible by the relationship between server sites and the ArcGIS Portal. Certain types of services can only be published to certain server sites. Services and administrative controls can be accessed by the RESTful API. On ArcGIS Server these are ArcGIS Server Services Directory and ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory.

##### Task: 
Configurable Solutions Menu (Wednesday Lab Period)
##### Date: 
March 17, 2021
##### Time: 
2:00 - 4:00
##### Total Time: 
2 hours
##### Outcomes: 
Learned the basics of ArcGIS Experience Builder and its capabilities. Compared this with the function and capabilities of Web App builder. Experience Builder: creates a web app; selection of configurable tools, widgets and templates (or can design your own template); no coding necessary; fully integrated with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise; can incorporate 2D and 3D content in one map. Web App Builder: creates a mapping application on the web; built in tools available; create 2D or 3D web maps; custom widgets and themes can be developed; no coding required; built into ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. Note: widgets and configurable tools can not be copied from Web App Builder to Experience Builder.

##### Task: 
Publishing to EC2 Server, Creat Duck Dns and obtain SSL Certificate 
##### Date: 
March 17, 2021
##### Time: 
4:00 - 5:30
##### Total Time: 
1.5 hours
##### Outcomes: 
Published the Canada Map from ArcGIS Pro to the EC2 server. To do this I got the server running in AWS, added the server connection in ArcGIS Pro and published from Pro. In order to reference the data on the server and not copy the data when publishing, the Canada folder in my directory was zipped and copied to a folder in the same filepath on the EC2. This enabled the data to be referenced when publishing. Prior to this, I created a Duck Dns for my server url which I used when creating the server connection in ArcGIS Pro. I also obtained an SSL certificate to avoid certificating issues when trying to publish.

##### To Do: 
Update the IP address of the EC2 on the Duck Dns each time the server is started otherwise the url will not work as the IP address will change each time.

##### Total Time: 
2 hours
##### Outcomes: 
Discussed the web solution for our collab project and worked on completing the problem statement for the Web GIS Group Web Solution Project. As a team we decided to pursue ArcGIS Experience builder to create an interactive web application to provide information on hydrological systems. Experience builder was chosen as it provides lots of functionality and flexibility which we believe will be useful for our web solution needs. 
##### Resources: 

##### To Do: 
Begin planning the design of the ArcGIS Experience Builder web solution we intend to build to solve our problem statement.
